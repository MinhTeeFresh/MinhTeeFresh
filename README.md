Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Minh Tran!

I am currently almost done with my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and I am looking for a position as a Junior Software Developer!

Right now I am interested in web application making and web design. I have previously worked in full-stack during my internships and am working towards making my Github reflect the experience I have. âœ…

I am looking to expand my skills and continue to produce amazing code! ðŸ’»

## Current Projects ðŸ“ˆ

### Personal Portfolio
An older project I started back awhile ago and never finished. I'll be working to finish that complete with my resume

### Youtube Queue List
I'm tired of opening up tab after tab when the click-bait works. I need to preserve that local storage you know? But their queue feature is locked behind Youtube Premium, so I'm making my own.
