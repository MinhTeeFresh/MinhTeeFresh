Hey there! 👋

My name is Minh Tran!

I am currently almost done with my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and I am looking for a position as a Junior Software Developer!

Right now I am interested in web application making and web design. I have previously worked in full-stack during my internships and am working towards making my Github reflect the experience I have. ✅

I am looking to expand my skills and continue to produce amazing code! 💻

## Current Projects 📈

I am working with my team to create a sorting process to organize FAA NOTAMs to allow faster and easier access for pilots

### Personal Portfolio
An older project I started back awhile ago and never finished. I'll be working to finish that complete with my resume

### Club Website
I will be working with club member executives to create the website for the newly formed UI/UX Club at my university
